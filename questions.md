# Design Notes

1. Let's start with one BME688, and enabling the second one later
2. Interface mode is I2C, controlled by #define USE_I2C_INTERFACE (what a bloody old-school way to do this...)
3. I2C address used is BME68X_I2C_ADDR_HIGH or BME68X_I2C_ADDR_LOW

# Initializing the BME688 interface :
1. populate a bme68x_dev struct
    bme68x_g.intf  = BME68X_I2C_INTF;
    dev_addr       = BME68X_I2C_ADDR_HIGH;
    bme68x_g.read  = bme68x_i2c_read; <-- pointers to OUR platforms I2C read function
    bme68x_g.write = bme68x_i2c_write; <-- pointers to OUR platforms I2C write function
    bme68x_g.delay_us = sleep; <-- pointer to us sleep function on our platform
    bme68x_g.intf_ptr = &dev_addr; <-- ???  
    bme68x_g.amb_temp = 25;

2. Call ret.bme68x_status = bme68x_init(&bme68x_g); with this struct as parameter
3. return value is type int8_t bme68x_status; and is stored in member of return_values_init; struct



# Initializing BSEC library
1. call     ret.bsec_status = bsec_init(); // TODO need to check parameters...


# load (BSEC ?) library config
bsec_config_len = config_load(bsec_config, sizeof(bsec_config));



# Start (?) library ??
ret.bsec_status = bme68x_bsec_update_subscription(sample_rate);




# Questions about Bosch BME688, DevKit, BSEC and AI-Studio #

## BME688 ##

The new sensor needs to be conditioned before the example can work reliably. You may run this example for 24hrs to let the sensor stabilize.
Once ? 




## DevKit ##
* What does BLE do ? It seems to be a serial link over bluetooth, to send measurements and receive config



## Files ##

*/.aiconfig : JSON format, seems to contain output from AI-Studio, which is read back into the MCU as a config to BSEC lib
*/.aipredictions : JSON format, 
*/.bmeconfig : JSON format, seems generated by AI studio which is read back into the MCU as a config to BSEC lib
*/.bmelabelingo : JSON format
*/.bmerawdata : JSON format, some contents can be interpreted by the labels in 'dataColumns'
